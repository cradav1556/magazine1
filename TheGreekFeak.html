<p><em>The Reason i look up to giannis is because most people say i look like him and i believe them so i try to focus on the moves he does so i can do them something like how he does.Some people say giannis cant compete with lebron but i believe he can he is athletic like lebron and he has somewhat the same defense as lebron.Last season, he became the first player in NBA history to finish in the top-20 league-wide in all five major statistics: points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. He also led his team in all five categories, only the fifth player in NBA history to do so</em></p>
